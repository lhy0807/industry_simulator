# industry_simulator

This project is finished by RPI student Hongyu Li and Prof. Ken Simons.

The simulator helps you understand how common industry dynamics can
arise, including industry shakeouts of differing degrees and non-shakeout competitive patterns. You can use this simulator on
your own or as a group.
